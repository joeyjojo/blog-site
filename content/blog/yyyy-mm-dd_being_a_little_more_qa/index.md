As a consultant, after the stakeholder shenanigans have been completed, the first thing I do is go talk to the QA community. The health of the QA community within an organisation is often a key indicator as to whether the organisation is going to make it through whatever we have been asked to do. QAs regardless of whether they are constrained by the system in which they operate, have to understand the dependencies and processes that gets working software to the user, even in the most siloed of organisations. It's my opinion that the future of software development, lies in QA. As machine generated code moves up the stack, more and more of our responsibility will lie in defining, observing and validating the system and its behavior rather than typing the letters that make it work.
