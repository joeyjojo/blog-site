So you want to do #noestimates but some people in your organisation can't live without their estimates... how do you convince them otherwise?

## Prepare
Its important that you have a few other things in order before you transition. So here are a few tips.

1. The time between the time your stories are created and when they are implemented is important. The greater the time between those 2 events the worse your estimates would have been, but also the worse any forecasts are going to be. If stories are generated more than a month in advance of the work... its going to be tough.

1. Understand what done means for you... Ideally done means "In production being used by our users" but this may not necessarily be the case for you, your team and most importantly your process control board (Scrum/Kanban/whatever).

1. Often, estimation sessions real value isn't in the act of estimating... its in the act of the whole team being in a room discussing the scope of the work. #noestimates does not mean that other important activities around scoping and alignment do not happen. It just means that we are replacing estimation with forecasting. You will as a team still need to make time for these other activities.

## Timebox
I love a good timebox. Now, a lot of 'agile' developers will be used to timeboxes when it comes to things like spikes, where the main objective is learning. Well guess what? Lucky you! It turns out the main objective of most work should be the learning :)

So timebox!!

As a story is solidifying, I ask the team the question... Could you get this to done in 5 days?

I re-iterate that done means:
- In the hands of our users
- This is elapsed not working time

If the answer is 'No' we break the story down.

Now sometimes... a story is resistent to being broken down to less than 5 days elapsed. Lets say it relies on an external team that can't be relied upon. If we genuinely feel this is the case, that it can't be broken down then we leave it alone.
