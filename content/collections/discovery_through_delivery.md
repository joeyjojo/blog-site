"Discovery through Delivery" is a compilation of the techniques and methods I currently use and advocate for when developing software. The inspiration for this was the article ["The uncomfortable world of constant discovery"]("http://www.defmyfunc.com/2019-06-12_the_uncomfortable_world_of_constan_discovery") which upon writing, made me want to expand upon the important day to day activities I see and partake in when delivering software. It is also inspired by the release of things like ["The North Star playbook"]("https://amplitude.com/north-star) and ["Shape Up"]("https://basecamp.com/shapeup/webbook") which highlight how those organisations approach and deliver software.

This page will serve as links to others that over time will cover as many aspects of software development as I get round to writing. It will probably never be finished and will be constantly updated as my opinion change.

Happy reading and hope it helps!
